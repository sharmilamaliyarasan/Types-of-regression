# Prediction Using Lasso & Ridge Regression
## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview

This project predicts prices using Lasso and Ridge regression, two types of linear regression with regularization:

Lasso Regression (L1): Helps with feature selection by shrinking less important coefficients to zero.

Ridge Regression (L2): Shrinks coefficients to reduce overfitting while keeping all features.

Both models aim to predict car prices accurately, but they differ in how they handle features and overfitting.

## ðŸ—‚ Dataset Details

Input Features: x1, x2, x3 etc.

Target Variable: y

Purpose: Predict prices and analyze feature importance

ðŸ“Š Visualization



## Regression Equation:
Price â‰ˆ Intercept + Î£(Coefficient Ã— Feature)

## âœ… Insights & Notes

Lasso:

Great for feature selection

Highlights most influential features 

Reduces overfitting by ignoring insignificant features

Ridge:

Great for stable predictions

Retains all features while reducing variance

Works well with correlated features

Comparison:

Lasso = Best for understanding feature importance

Ridge = Best for prediction accuracy with multicollinearity

## âœ… Conclusion

Lasso Regression: Efficient for identifying key features and controlling overfitting.

Ridge Regression: Provides stable predictions in the presence of correlated features while keeping all features.

Both approaches complement each other: Lasso for interpretation, Ridge for predictive stability.
